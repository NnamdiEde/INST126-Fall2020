Project 1
My code is for usage of making simple calculations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and subtraction. The first thing to do to operate the code is that you must select the operation for what you want the code to do. To do that, you must first enter your choice of operation A, S, M, D, P. “M” for multiplication, “A” for addition, “D”, for division, “S” for subtraction, and finally “P” for power. You must then select the numbers you wish to operate with, so if you trying to find out “What is 8 *9?”, you  would select M for choice, since your using multiplication, and press enter,  select the first number 8, and press enter, then select the second number 9 and press enter, and there you go a full functioning calculator!


Project 2 my code consists of two different codes, one where you play hang man, and another where you decrypt encrypted words. For the hangman code there are a list of words that the correct word can be WHDSPQZ', 'XHO', 'TTDBFRT', 'QQJYF', 'ENQD', 'DNPK', 'CNTR', 'EHWHOD', 'TSVMOHOF', 'XNOCFQGTM'. You have 10 tries to try and guess the correct letter fo the word, if you guessed the correct letter it will say "Congrats, you guessed the correct letter" if you make an incorrect guess it will say "Sorry you got it wrong my guy", guess the correct letters you win, if you cannot do it in 10 tries, the program stops and you lose. For my second code it decodes cipher texts, so you just enter a word, ad press enter, and your cipher text will be decoded into the real word.
