Project 1
My code is for usage of making simple calculations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and subtraction. The first thing to do to operate the code is that you must select the operation for what you want the code to do. To do that, you must first enter your choice of operation A, S, M, D, P. “M” for multiplication, “A” for addition, “D”, for division, “S” for subtraction, and finally “P” for power. You must then select the numbers you wish to operate with, so if you trying to find out “What is 8 *9?”, you  would select M for choice, since your using multiplication, and press enter,  select the first number 8, and press enter, then select the second number 9 and press enter, and there you go a full functioning calculator!
